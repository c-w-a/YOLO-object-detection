# YOLOv5-DeepLearning-Notebook

tinkering with the YOLOv5 object detection model and the YouTube Bounding Boxes dataset..

PROJECT PLAN:
create an easy-to-use notebook that will allow others to train YOLOv5 object detection models using a subset of the YouTube Bounding Boxes dataset by abstracting and automating the entire process including environment set-up, data filtering, data acquisition, frame extraction, label generation, dataset splitting, YOLOv5 training preparation, etc. 

COMPLETED FEATURES SO FAR:
- data filtering
- data acquisition
- frame extraction
- label generation
- dataset splitting
- data organization (YOLOv5-ready format)

instructions:
- clone repo
- run set-up script (in progress..)
-
